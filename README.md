This Repo contains a presentation briefly discusses main concepts related to Genetic Algorithms.
The Major topics covered are
1. Types of Representation
2. Parent Selection
3. Selection Pressure
4. Population Management

It also includes the implementation of famous Knapsack Problem. The problem is implemented in two ways.
1. Implementation of core functions of Genetic Algorithm
2. Implementing using Pygad library
